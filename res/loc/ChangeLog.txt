This file lists all the changes that have been applied to the en-US translation of
rufus.loc since its original version.

To edit a translation, please make sure to follow:
https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Localization#Editing_a_translation
Or simply download the latest pollock.exe from https://rufus.ie/locale/ and follow
its directions. 

o v3.5
  - *NEW*      MSG_127 "Do not show this message again"
  - *NEW*      MSG_128 "Important notice about %s" where %s will be one of "MBR", "Secure Boot", "Windows To Go"
  - *NEW*      MSG_129 "You have just created a media that includes the UEFI:NTFS bootloader (...)"
  - *NEW*      MSG_130 "Windows image selection"
  - *NEW*      MSG_131 "This ISO contains multiple Windows images.\nPlease select the image you wish to use for this installation:"
  - *NEW*      MSG_132 "Another program or process is accessing this drive. Do you want to format it anyway?"
  - *NEW*      MSG_133 "Rufus has detected that you are attempting to create a Windows To Go media based on a 1809 ISO. (...)"
  - *NEW*      MSG_134 "Because MBR has been selected for the partition scheme, Rufus can only create a partition up to 2 TB (...)"

o v3.2 (2018.07.20)
	The following appears in Advanced format options → Check device for bad blocks → dropdown menu with
  %s being replaced with SLC, MLC or TLC, which is a type of NAND (or flash memory. In other words,
  this message should mean "for a flash memory device of type %s". *Please* try to keep the translation
  as short as possible so that it won't result in an overly large dropdown...
  See https://www.mydigitaldiscount.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-slc-mlc-and-tlc-nand-flash.html
  - *NEW*      MSG_087 "for %s NAND"
  The following 4 messages can be tested using https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/raw/master/res/loc/test/casper_test.iso
  - *NEW*      MSG_123 "Persistent partition size"
  - *NEW*      MSG_124 "No persistence"
  - *NEW*      MSG_125 "Set the size of the persistent partition for live USB media. Setting the size to 0 disables the persistent partition."
  - *NEW*      MSG_126 "Set the partition size units."
  As of Rufus 3.2, *ALL* downloads from the servers are digitally signed, and their signature is validated using the
  public key that is embedded in the application. This message appears in an error dialog if the validation fails.
  - *NEW*      MSG_172 "Invalid download signature"
  This message was present in 3.0, but I forgot to mention it then. It has to do with the signature
  validation that Rufus uses when downloading an update.
  - *NEW*      MSG_240 "The signature for the downloaded update can not be validated (...)"
  You can see this status message by pressing <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Z> and then selecting Start.
  It's the same as MSG_286 but with a process that *may* be faster, hence the name.
  - *NEW*      MSG_306 "Fast-zeroing drive: %0.1f%% completed"
  Note: Because this is the introduction of a new translation framework, and I am a bit short of time for that
  unification of MSG_084/MSG_104/MSG_114/MSG_116 will happen in another translation round...

o v3.0 (2018.03.27)
  - All positioning ('m', 's') has now been removed as well as some controls, for the 3.0 UI redesign
  - *NEW*      IDS_DRIVE_PROPERTIES_TXT "Drive Properties"
  - *NEW*      IDS_BOOT_SELECTION_TXT "Boot selection"
               Note: The current translation was taken from MSG_278 when available, which was for "Boot type".
               However, "Boot selection", is more appropriate, so please update if it makes sense.
  - *NEW*      IDC_SELECT "Select"
  - *NEW*      IDS_IMAGE_OPTION_TXT "Image Option"
  - *UPDATED*  IDS_PARTITION_TYPE_TXT Partition scheme and target system type -> "Partition scheme"
  - *NEW*      IDS_TARGET_SYSTEM_TXT "Target system"
  - *REPLACED* IDS_LABEL_TXT "New Volume label" -> "Volume label"
  - *NEW*      IDS_STATUS_TXT "Status"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_031 -> "BIOS (or UEFI-CSM)"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_032 -> "UEFI (non CSM)"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_033 -> "BIOS or UEFI" 
  - *REMOVED*  MSG_087
  - *RENAMED*  IDC_WINDOWS_INSTALL -> MSG_117
  - *RENAMED*  IDC_WINDOWS_TO_GO -> MSG_118
               Note: In most cases, you should not have to add MSG_118 as the English for "Windows To Go" should work for most countries.
  - *NEW*      MSG_119 "advanced drive properties"
  - *NEW*      MSG_120 "advanced format options"
  - *NEW*      MSG_121 "Show %s"
  - *NEW*      MSG_122 "Hide %s"
     MSG_119/120 + MSG_121/122 are used to create the advanced options clickable toolbars
  - *REPLACED* MSG_150 -> "Type of computer you plan to use this bootable drive with. It is your responsibility to determine whether "
                          "your target is of BIOS or UEFI type before you start creating the drive, as it may fail to boot otherwise."
  - *REPLACED* MSG_151 -> "'UEFI-CSM' means that the device will only boot in BIOS emulation mode (also known as 'Legacy Mode') under UEFI, and not in native UEFI mode."
               Be mindful that you probably don't want to translate 'Legacy Mode' as this is an option that usually appears in English in the UEFI settings.
  - *REPLACED* MSG_152 -> "'non CSM' means that the device will only boot in native UEFI mode, and not in BIOS emulation mode (also known as 'Legacy Mode')."
  - *REPLACED* MSG_163 -> "Method that will be used to create partitions"
  - *REMOVED*  MSG_172
  - *REMOVED*  MSG_199
  - *REMOVED*  MSG_200
  - *NEW*      MSG_278 "Checking for conflicting processes..."
  - *REPLACED* MSG_280 "Image selection" -> "Disk or ISO image"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_281 "(Please select an image)" -> "%s (Please select)"
     MSG_281 + MSG_280 are used to create the message that appears in the boot selection dropdown when an image has not been selected.
  - *UPDATED*  MSG_298 The '#' button is now the (✓) button
  - *NEW*      MSG_299 "Timestamp validation error"
  - *NEW*      MSG_300 "Rufus could not validate that the timestamp of the downloaded update is more recent than the one for the "
                       "current executable.\n\nIn order to prevent potential attack scenarios, the update process has been aborted and "
                       "the download will be deleted. Please check the log for more details."
  - *NEW*      MSG_301 "Show application settings"
  - *NEW*      MSG_302 "Show information about this application"
  - *NEW*      MSG_303 "Show the log"
  - *NEW*      MSG_304 "Create a disk image of the selected device"
  - *NEW*      MSG_305 "Use this option to indicate whether you want to use this device to install Windows on another disk, "
                        "or if you want to run Windows directly from this drive (Windows To Go)."
  - *UPDATED*  On IDD_LOG, IDC_LOG_CLEAR, IDC_LOG_SAVE and IDCANCEL were updated to remove the redundant mention of "Log" in the buttons
               for the languages who did that. This means that "Save Log", "Clear Log" "Close Log" have become "Save", "Clear", "Close".
               *PLEASE* verify that the modification looks correct in your language.

o v2.16 (2017.07.17)
  - *NEW* MSG_295 "Warning: Unofficial version"
  - *NEW* MSG_296 "This version of Rufus was NOT produced by its official developer(s).\n\nAre you sure you want to run it?"
  - *NEW* MSG_297 "Truncated ISO detected"
  - *NEW* MSG_298 "The ISO file you have selected does not match its declared size: %s of data is missing!\n\nIf you obtained "
    "this file from the Internet, you should try to download a new copy and verify that the MD5 or SHA checksums match the "
    "official ones.\n\nNote that you can compute the MD5 or SHA in Rufus by clicking the '#' button."
  Note: You can test MSG_297/MSG_298 using https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/raw/master/res/loc/test/arch_trunc.iso
  A truncated version of archlinux-2017.07.01-x86_64.iso)

o v2.12 (2017.01.16)
  - *NEW* MSG_288 "Missing elevated privileges"
  - *NEW* MSG_289 "This application can only run with elevated privileges"
    This message, along with the previous, is just to notify the user when they have
    managed to run Rufus in non-elevated mode. This shouldn't happen in most case
    so this is not something that you can easily test.
  - *NEW* MSG_290 "File Indexing"
    This is a cheat mode that can be tested with Alt-Q, that is equivalent to the
    "Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed in addition to file properties"
    (i.e. file indexing) option one can see when looking at the drive properties. See:
    https://rufus.akeo.ie/pics/FileIndexing.png
  - *NEW* MSG_291 "Version selection"
  - *NEW* MSG_292 "Please select the version of Windows you want to install:"
    These two messages are used when the user has the possibility to select between
    multiple versions of Windows in Windows To Go mode. In this case, a prompt like
    this will appear, using these 2 messages: https://rufus.akeo.ie/pics/Win2GoVersion.png
    If you have an official Windows ISO, and the platform you run Rufus on supports
    Windows To Go (Windows 8 or later *ONLY*), you should be able to test this message.
  - *NEW* MSG_293 "Unsupported Windows version"
  - *NEW* MSG_294 "This version of Windows is no longer supported by Rufus."
    These two messages are not used anywhere yet, but may be needed in a future prompt.

o v2.9 (2016.05.09)
  - *NEW* MSG_286 "Zeroing drive: %0.1f%% completed"
    Used when filling a whole drive with zero bytes, to display progress in percent (e.g. "Zeroing drive: 12.3% completed")
    Can be tested with Alt-Z (CAUTION: THIS WILL COMPLETELY ERASE THE SELECTED DRIVE!!)
  - *NEW* MSG_287 "Detection of non-USB removable drives"
    Note, this message is followed by either "enabled"/"disabled" (see MSG_250/251) and is similar to MSG_253
    The message appears on the status bar and can be tested with Ctrl-Alt-F.

o v2.5 (2015.10.15)
    Note: The following message can be tested by pressing Alt-, (That's the 'Alt' and 'comma' keys on your keyboard)
          In case the message below is not clear, you can consider that it says "Exclusive locking of the USB drive"
  - *NEW* MSG_282 "Exclusive USB drive locking"
    Note: The following messages will appear after a new Rufus update has been downloaded from the
          Internet in case something is very wrong with its digital signature...
  - *NEW* MSG_283 "Invalid signature"
  - *NEW* MSG_284 "The downloaded executable is missing a digital signature."
  - *NEW* MSG_285 "The downloaded executable is signed by '%s'.\nThis is not a signature we recognize and could "
                  "indicate some form of malicious activity...\nAre you sure you want to run this file?"

o v2.4 (2015.09.03)
  - Changed MSG_081 "Unsupported ISO" -> "Unsupported image"
  - Changed MSG_082 -> "This image is either non-bootable, or it uses a boot or compression method that is not supported by Rufus..."
  - *NEW* MSG_269 "Preserve timestamps"
    Note: You can use the Alt-T cheat mode to see this message. Also, if 'timestamp' doesn't really translate in your language,
    "file dates preservation" is a good approximation of what this is about.
  - *NEW* MSG_270 "USB debug"
    Note: You can use the Alt-. cheat mode to see the message above
  For an idea of what the 'checksums' in the 2 messages below are used for, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum:
  - *NEW* MSG_271 "Computing image checksums: %0.1f%% completed"
  - *NEW* MSG_272 "Compute the SHA1 and MD5 checksums for the selected image"
  - *NEW* MSG_273 "Change the application language"
    Note: You can see the message above by hovering on the language button
