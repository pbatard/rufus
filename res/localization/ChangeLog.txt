This file lists any change that has been applied to the en-US translation of
rufus.loc since its original version. Translators are expected to keep their
translations up to date by monitoring this file on regular basis and applying
the same changes.

When editing an existing translation, make sure you always follow:
https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Localization#Editing_a_translation

Remember to also update the version number for your translation ('v x.y.z')
once you have matched all the changes that occurred for the en-US translation.

!!IMPORTANT!! The changes below do NOT contain the full message and only tell
you WHERE, in the English translation, you should look to find the full message
content. PLEASE, do not just look at this Changelog when updating your
translation, but always use the English section of rufus.loc as your base.
For instance, MSG_114, that was introduced in v1.0.8 is MORE than one line!
