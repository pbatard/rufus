This file lists any change that has been applied to the en-US translation of
rufus.loc since its original version. Translators are expected to keep their
translations up to date by monitoring this file on regular basis and applying
the same changes.

When editing an existing translation, make sure you always follow:
https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Localization#Editing_a_translation

Remember to also update the version number for your translation ('v x.y.z')
once you have matched all the changes that occurred for the en-US translation.

!!IMPORTANT!! The changes below may NOT contain the full message and only tell
you WHERE, in the English translation, you should look to find the full message
content. PLEASE, do not just look at this Changelog when updating your
translation, but always use the English section of rufus.loc as your base.
For instance, MSG_114, that was introduced in v1.0.8 is MORE than one line!

o Version 1.0.23 (2018.??.??)
  - All positioning ('m', 's') has now been removed as well as some controls, for the 3.0 UI redesign
  - Removed: MSG_086, MSG_087, MSG_163
  - *NEW*      IDS_DRIVE_PROPERTIES_TXT "Drive Properties"
  - *NEW*      IDS_BOOT_SELECTION_TXT "Boot selection"
               Note: The current translation was taken from MSG_278 when available, which was for "Boot type".
               However, "Boot selection", is more appropriate, so please update if it makes sense.
  - *NEW*      IDC_SELECT "SELECT"
  - *NEW*      IDS_IMAGE_OPTION_TXT "Image Option"
  - *UPDATED*  IDS_PARTITION_TYPE_TXT Partition scheme and target system type -> "Partition scheme"
  - *NEW*      IDS_TARGET_SYSTEM_TXT "Target system"
  - *NEW*      IDS_STATUS_TXT "Status"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_031 -> "BIOS (or UEFI-CSM)"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_032 -> "UEFI (non CSM)"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_033 -> "BIOS or UEFI" 
  - *REMOVED*  MSG_087
	- *RENAMED*  IDC_WINDOWS_INSTALL -> MSG_117

  - *NEW*      MSG_119 "advanced drive properties"
  - *NEW*      MSG_120 "advanced format options"
  - *NEW*      MSG_121 "Show %s"
  - *NEW*      MSG_122 "Hide %s"
     MSG_119/120 + MSG_121/122 are used to create the advanced options clickable toolbars
  - *REPLACED* MSG_150 -> "Type of computer you plan to use this bootable drive with. It is up to YOU to find whether your target is of BIOS or UEFI type.\n"
	                        "Be mindful that CSM, which can be enabled or disabled on UEFI computers, means 'BIOS emulation', and is not really UEFI."
  - *REPLACED* MSG_151 -> "Note: 'UEFI-CSM' means that the device will only boot in BIOS emulation mode (also known as 'Legacy Mode') under UEFI, and not in native UEFI mode."
               Be mindful that you probably don't want to translate 'Legacy Mode' as this is an option that usually appears in English in the UEFI settings.
  - *REPLACED* MSG_152 -> "Note: 'non CSM' means that the device will only boot in native UEFI mode, and not in BIOS emulation mode (also known as 'Legacy Mode')."
  - *REPLACED* MSG_163 -> "Method that will be used to create partitions."
  - *NEW*      MSG_278 "Checking for conflicting processes..."
  - *REPLACED* MSG_280 "Image selection" -> "Disk or ISO image"
  - *REPLACED* MSG_281 "(Please select an image)" -> "%s (Please select)"
     MSG_281 + MSG_280 are used to create the message that appears in the boot selection dropdown when an image has not been selected.
  - *NEW*      MSG_299 "Timestamp validation error"
  - *NEW*      MSG_300 "Rufus could not validate that the timestamp of the downloaded update is more recent than the one for the "
	                     "current executable.\n\nIn order to prevent potential attack scenarios, the update process has been aborted and "
	                     "the download will be deleted. Please check the log for more details."
	- *NEW*      MSG_301 "Show application settings"
  - *NEW*      MSG_302 "Show information about this application"
  - *NEW*      MSG_303 "Show the log"
  - *NEW*      MSG_314 "Create a disk image of the selected device"
  - *UPDATED*  On IDD_LOG, IDC_LOG_CLEAR, IDC_LOG_SAVE and IDCANCEL were updated to remove the redundant mention of "Log" in the buttons
               for the languages who did that. *PLEASE* verify that the modification looks correct in your language.
  - *UPDATED*  Log dialog buttons (in the 'g IDD_LOG' section). "Save Log", "Clear Log" "Close Log" have become "Save", "Clear", "Close".
               I updated existing translations to remove the mention of "Log". Please check that it was done properly.

o Version 1.0.22 (2017.07.17)
  - *NEW* MSG_295 "Warning: Unofficial version"
  - *NEW* MSG_296 "This version of Rufus was NOT produced by its official developer(s).\n\nAre you sure you want to run it?"
  - *NEW* MSG_297 "Truncated ISO detected"
  - *NEW* MSG_298 "The ISO file you have selected does not match its declared size: %s of data is missing!\n\nIf you obtained "
    "this file from the Internet, you should try to download a new copy and verify that the MD5 or SHA checksums match the "
    "official ones.\n\nNote that you can compute the MD5 or SHA in Rufus by clicking the '#' button."
  Note: You can test MSG_297/MSG_298 using https://rufus.akeo.ie/testing/arch_trunc.iso (A truncated version of archlinux-2017.07.01-x86_64.iso)

o Version 1.0.21 (2017.01.16)
  - *NEW* MSG_288 "Missing elevated privileges"
  - *NEW* MSG_289 "This application can only run with elevated privileges"
    This message, along with the previous, is just to notify the user when they have
    managed to run Rufus in non-elevated mode. This shouldn't happen in most case
    so this is not something that you can easily test.
  - *NEW* MSG_290 "File Indexing"
    This is a cheat mode that can be tested with Alt-Q, that is equivalent to the
    "Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed in addition to file properties"
    (i.e. file indexing) option one can see when looking at the drive properties. See:
    https://rufus.akeo.ie/pics/FileIndexing.png
  - *NEW* MSG_291 "Version selection"
  - *NEW* MSG_292 "Please select the version of Windows you want to install:"
    These two messages are used when the user has the possibility to select between
    multiple versions of Windows in Windows To Go mode. In this case, a prompt like
    this will appear, using these 2 messages: https://rufus.akeo.ie/pics/Win2GoVersion.png
    If you have an official Windows ISO, and the platform you run Rufus on supports
    Windows To Go (Windows 8 or later *ONLY*), you should be able to test this message.
  - *NEW* MSG_293 "Unsupported Windows version"
  - *NEW* MSG_294 "This version of Windows is no longer supported by Rufus."
    These two messages are not used anywhere yet, but may be needed in a future prompt.

o Version 1.0.20 (2016.05.09)
  - *NEW* MSG_286 "Zeroing drive: %0.1f%% completed"
    Used when filling a whole drive with zero bytes, to display progress in percent (e.g. "Zeroing drive: 12.3% completed")
    Can be tested with Alt-Z (CAUTION: THIS WILL COMPLETELY ERASE THE SELECTED DRIVE!!)
  - *NEW* MSG_287 "Detection of non-USB removable drives"
    Note, this message is followed by either "enabled"/"disabled" (see MSG_250/251) and is similar to MSG_253
    The message appears on the status bar and can be tested with Ctrl-Alt-F.

o Version 1.0.19 (2015.10.15)
    Note: The following message can be tested by pressing Alt-, (That's the 'Alt' and 'comma' keys on your keyboard)
          In case the message below is not clear, you can consider that it says "Exclusive locking of the USB drive"
  - *NEW* MSG_282 "Exclusive USB drive locking"
    Note: The following messages will appear after a new Rufus update has been downloaded from the
          Internet in case something is very wrong with its digital signature...
  - *NEW* MSG_283 "Invalid signature"
  - *NEW* MSG_284 "The downloaded executable is missing a digital signature."
  - *NEW* MSG_285 "The downloaded executable is signed by '%s'.\nThis is not a signature we recognize and could "
                  "indicate some form of malicious activity...\nAre you sure you want to run this file?"

o Version 1.0.18 (2015.09.03)
  - Changed MSG_081 "Unsupported ISO" -> "Unsupported image"
  - Changed MSG_082 -> "This image is either non-bootable, or it uses a boot or compression method that is not supported by Rufus..."
  - *NEW* MSG_269 "Preserve timestamps"
    Note: You can use the Alt-T cheat mode to see this message. Also, if 'timestamp' doesn't really translate in your language,
    "file dates preservation" is a good approximation of what this is about.
  - *NEW* MSG_270 "USB debug"
    Note: You can use the Alt-. cheat mode to see the message above
  For an idea of what the 'checksums' in the 2 messages below are used for, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum:
  - *NEW* MSG_271 "Computing image checksums: %0.1f%% completed"
  - *NEW* MSG_272 "Compute the SHA1 and MD5 checksums for the selected image"
  - *NEW* MSG_273 "Change the application language"
    Note: You can see the message above by hovering on the language button
  - *NEW* MSG_274 "ISOHybrid image detected"
    Note: You can test this message and the one below by downloading and trying to write the latest menu_c32_test.iso (120 KB) from:

    This message appears in the new Info field that was added to Rufus 2.0 and reflects
    when the application is ready to take an action from the user.
