######################## HOW TO ADD A NEW TRANSLATION ###########################
# For a more comprehensive set of instructions, please see the *FULL* Localization guide at:
# https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Localization
#
# 0. Download the latest Rufus executable, start it and check the log for a line starting with 'LCID'
#    (eg. LCID 0x1809).
# 1. Save this file in the same directory where you have the Rufus executable.
# 2. Copy the lines between ### TRANSLATOR START COPY ### and ### TRANSLATOR END COPY ### and paste them at
#    the end of the file.
# 3. Edit the 'l' line in the section you copied and:
#    - replace the "en-US" IETF language tag for your language, eg: "fr-FR", "zh-CN".
#      See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag as well as the table on page 9 of
#      http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/E/95EF66AF-9026-4BB0-A41D-A4F81802D92C/%5BMS-LCID%5D.pdf
#    - set the name of your language first in English and then, in parenthesis, in your own language.
#      eg: "Chinese Simplified (简体中文)"
#    - remove the end of the line starting with 0x0409 and replaced it with the LCID code you got in step 0.
#      You also may want to look at the table on page 9 of the PDF above to add all the LCID codes your
#      translation should cover. Make sure you separate these codes with a comma.
# 4. Translate the messages that appear below into your language. The 'g' lines indicate the group a translated
#    element belongs to. You shouldn't have to modify them.
# 5. (Re)launch Rufus. If a 'rufus.loc' file is found in the current directory, it will be used over the one
#    embedded in the application. Since there is only one translation in this file, it will be used by default
# 6. Repeat steps 4 & 5 until you're happy with that translated elements. Note that you MUST restart Rufus every
#    time you change your .loc file as there is no reload option.
# 7. Once you are satisfied with your translation, you should pick up the official rufus.loc from:
#    https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/raw/master/res/localization/rufus.loc
#    You should then add your translation at the end of it, and confirm that it is still picked as the default
#    for your system  You can also force the use of a translation by passing the option -l when starting Rufus.
#    For instance, to have the "zh_CN" translation below apply, you could use either one of:
#      rufus.exe -l zh-CN
#      rufus.exe -l 0x0404
#      rufus.exe -l 0x0804
# 8. If you need to resize a control or a dialog to fid the translated text, use the 'm' (Move) or 's' (reSize)
#    options. For an example of how these commands work, see https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Localization
#
# Tips:
# - Please make sure that you edit the language include *your* name and e-mail in MSG_176. It will be displayed
#   in the About dialog and I want to give you credit for your work!
# - I strongly recommend installing and using DbgView to check for translation errors, as you will get more
#   information about how Rufus initallly parses the translation file plus reports of any issue found (with
#   the line number). Download DbgView from: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx
# - As shown below, you can break a long message over multiple lines, as long as these fragments begin and end
#   with a double quote ("). Also be careful to keep the special symbols such as %d, %s, \\b, \",  \n.
# - Don't forget to check the translation guide from https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Localization
